This script launches a GUI which displays one image after the other and lets the user give different labels from a list provided as input to the script. In contrast to original version, version 2 allows for relabelling and keeping track of the labels. Provides also short-cuts - press "1" to put into "label 1", press "2" to put into "label 2" a.s.o.

## Usage:
run 'python sort_folder_vers2.py' or copy the script in a jupyter notebook and run then. You need also to provide your specific input in the preamble (source folder, labels, 'copy' or 'move' mode, path to tracker file, desired file extensions (.jpg, .png, ...) )
